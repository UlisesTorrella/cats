# Func

Func[F[_], A, B] generalizes functors A=>F[B]. Equiped with a map function, and a `run` function that lifts values from A to F[B].

We can also apply natural transformations to a Func using the equiped function `mapK`.

# AppFunc

Applicative functors can be composed, can traverse traversable functors, and we can obtain the product.
